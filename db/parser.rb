# DrugDB Parser
#   A proof of concept parser to pull in purchasing data from an Excel
#   file received from health centers.
#
#   Expects the purchasing file to be of the format:
#   Health Center     Drug Name     CPT Code    Count     Date
#
#   Writes the data into an SQLite database contained in the file 'drug.db'

require 'sqlite3'
